This project is a bugtracker project where it keeps track of tickets and the issues within the projects.

This currently uses MySQL as the server locally and NodeJS as the backend with EJS as the frontend.

As of right now it is still in progress.  Here is a list of things that have been done so far.

1. Created a database and tables within the NodeJS app.
2. Created data inside the server using the Insert Statements.
3. Tested the response the server sends back when directed to an endpoint.
4. Created SQL Statements to get counts of certain scenarios.
5. Writing functions and statements to display the results on the homepage.
6. Writing new functions while redesigning the front end dashboard.
7. Created routes in the route folder to shorten the app.js file.

# In Progress

1. Create submit ticket page and add insert statements into the database.


# To-Do

1. Create delete statements so admins can delete users or projects from the system.
2. Handle file uploads, namely the images attachments.
3. Create pages to edit tickets made by the user.
